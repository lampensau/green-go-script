This is a collection of useful scripts for devices running Green-GO v5 firmware.

The scripts are sorted into categories: 
- `local` (scripts that change something local to a device)
- `osc` (remote control/operation)
- `script-to-script` (device to device control/operation)
- `Snippets` (Prefabricated code segments/functions)
