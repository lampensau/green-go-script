# Integration Example for Bitfocus Companion

- **Created by:** Timo Toups

This script is meant as an example of how to implement a custom Bitfocus Companion integration using Companion's default OSC listener to manipulate the buttons.

> Note: Companion > 3.0-rc2 comes with a module for Green-GO that makes this script obsolete!
