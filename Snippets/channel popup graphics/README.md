# A Game of Whack a Mole

- **Created by:** Charles Phelps

> Note: Only compatible with MCX and MCXD devices and currently optimized to run on an MCXD exclusively.

After loading the script, channel 13 will show a green "MOLES!" button to trigger the start of
your hunt.

After starting you need to "catch" (touch) as many moles (smileys) as you can!
