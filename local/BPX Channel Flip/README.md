# (W)BPX Channel Flip

- **Created by:** Charles Phelps & Timo Toups

A script that enables the user to _flip_ through all his 32 channels by rotating the left encoder up or down. The script is in it's current form a little bit limited as it does not respect the actual channel configurations. It simply copies any channel assignment to the first four channels.
